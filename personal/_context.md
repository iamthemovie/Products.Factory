# Context: Personal

Domain-level constraints for personal projects.

---

## Constraints

- **Budget:** Personal savings only
- **Timeline:** Flexible — weekends, spare time
- **Resources:** Just me (unless I rope in friends/family)

## Goals

- Optimize for: **joy, learning, personal utility**
- Not optimizing for: profit, scale, enterprise features

## Decision Framework

- Prefer simple over sophisticated
- Prefer done over perfect
- If it's not fun, reconsider why I'm doing it

---

*Personal projects should spark joy. If they don't, archive them.*
